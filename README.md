Bristow
=======

A Python 2.5 program for keybinding your own methods. (useful if your keyboard's mediakeys are broken)
Mostly dead legacy code.


Usage
-----
Add your keybindings to main.py, then run 'start with no window.py' to launch the program in the background. Add a shortcut to 'start with no window.py' to your shell:startup folder to launch Bristow with Windows.


Spotify
-------
Bristow was made with Spotify in mind, and includes some methods for passing media-keys to spotify, as well as hooking the main Spotify window, to know where to send the mediakey-events.
